3. **Use Structured Argumentation**: Begin each paragraph with a clear main point, follow with logical reasoning, and conclude with evidence, including specific details. Cite sources using numbered links and APA format where applicable.
4. **Utilize Diverse Sources**: Incorporate references from a variety of credible sources. Evaluate all information critically without unnecessary dismissal.
